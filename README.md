# Netlify

## Intro

Frontend mini streaming platform application, working with <a href='https://vuejs.org/' target='_blank'>Vue.js</a> (vue-router, vuex, vue-axios, tailwindcss, jest). This is my first time using Vue, which gave me so much inspiration to continue using this framework. Easy to learn and use, this is just the beginning of this project which I will keep up working on it, implementing other features.

### Prerequisites

Current versions using on the project.

## Project setup

Get the code by either cloning this repository using git

```

```

... or downloading <a href='https://github.com/BorisKarakolev/netlify/archive/refs/heads/master.zip' target='_blank'>source code</a> as a zip archive.

Once downloaded, open the terminal in the project directory, and continue with:

```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
